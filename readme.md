Project “VaaniCare”: Voice-First AI Assistant for Inclusive Access to Essential Services

Many elderly, disabled, and illiterate individuals are unable to access critical services like healthcare, emergency support, legal aid, government welfare schemes, and employment because modern digital systems assume users can read, type, navigate apps, and understand English.

The Idea

VaaniCare is a voice-first, multilingual Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows users to access essential services entirely through speech.

Users simply speak in their local language (English & Malayalam for MVP), and VaaniCare:

Understands their intent

Guides them step-by-step using voice

Connects them to the right service

Assists with actions like bookings, applications, and discovery

The system behaves like a human assistant, not a chatbot.

How It Works (High-Level)

VaaniCare uses a multi-agent AI architecture, where each agent specializes in a service domain:

Healthcare Agent – hospitals, free treatment, appointments

Emergency Services Agent – urgent help, helplines, escalation

Legal Aid Agent – legal support, NGOs, basic guidance

Government Schemes Agent – eligibility, benefits, applications

Employment Agent – job discovery and guidance

An intent detection layer routes the user’s spoken request to the correct agent, while maintaining conversational context across multiple services.

Unique Selling Point (USP)

“If you can speak, you can access care.”

Unlike typical service apps that only provide information, VaaniCare performs actions:

Conversational data collection

Step-by-step guidance

Voice confirmations

Agent-driven task execution

No reading. No typing. No navigating complex menus.
